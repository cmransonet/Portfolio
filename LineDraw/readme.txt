LineDraw

Coded by Chet Ransonet

A simple OpenGL program that lets the user draw a colored line using mouse clicks (like a line tool in paint).
Click on any two spots in the window and a line will be drawn to connect those two points.
The program uses a variation of Bresenham's Line Algorithm to calculate where to draw each pixel.
The lines are colored with a gradient going from blue to yellow in the direction they are drawn.
Simple Anti-aliasing is used to make the lines looks 'smooth' and the lines overlap each other cleanly.
